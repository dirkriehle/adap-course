# Diagrams (ADAP) 

The EAP file contains the diagrams used in ADAP slides and examples.

The individual diagrams, after export, are stored in Generated / Diagrams, not in this folder.

The naming corresponds to the slide deck they are used in, e.g. A04 for Wahlzeit Design.

The underlying tool for EAP files is Sparx Enterprise Architect. 

Feel free to suggest an equally good open source tool and redo the diagrams.
